From now, I'll study deep learning.(test)

I'll make a blog with various Colab codes at other platform.
Sourcetree also will be use to push from my computer easily.

In my Github, 
1. I'll use only English.
   (I'm not good at English, but I'll try my best using a Google translator.)
2. Tested codes in Colab will be released.
3. Collaboration activity will be started after novice study.
